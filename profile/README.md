# Welcome to the Sustainable Africa Initiative ðŸ‘‹

The Sustainable Africa Initiative (SAI) aims to address the Climate Risk Related Challenges faced by African nations as they seek to maintain and accelerate economic growth while transitioning their economies to a Low Carbon World.

## Overview
SAI aims to encourage collaboration, enhance awareness of the potential climate-related risks in Africa, and create an open-source platform offering Africans access to physical and transition risk data, cloud-based infrastructure resources, analytical tools, and self-service training. 

This platform leverages [OS-Climate](https://github.com/os-climate/OS-Climate-Community-Hub#os-climate-community-hub) infrastructure and analytical tools to enable the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies that reduce the impact of physical climate change and a shift towards a low-carbon world.

## Current Projects
### Nigeria: Climate Risk Research Challenge

Challenge participants from ten Nigerian universities will receive access to the data, tools, models, infrastructure, and mentorship needed to assess climate change hazards, vulnerabilities, and impacts on Nigeria's agriculture sector with the goal of identifying potential adaptation strategies.  The Challenge offers $10,000 in grants to the top three individuals or teams.

With the support of OS-Climate members and volunteers such as Amazon, Red Hat and others, the Challenge aims to measure the food security risk to the population in the region and includes submissions of potential mitigation strategies.
